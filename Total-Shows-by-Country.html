            <p class="visualization-info">The image presents a world map visualization displaying the total number of
                shows streamed by country on a
                video streaming platform.
                The map highlights the United States in North America as having the highest count of 253 shows
                available.
                Other regions, such as Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa and South America,
                are also shaded, indicating the availability of content in those areas, albeit with lower show counts
                compared to the United States.
                This visualization provides a global perspective on the distribution of the platform's content library
                across different countries and regions.
